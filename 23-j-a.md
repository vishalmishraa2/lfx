**Key Reminders:**

* **Implicit Skills:** Some projects might have implicit requirements like familiarity with Git, Docker for local development, or basic Linux knowledge. Always review the full description on the LFX page.
* **Company Deduction:** I've inferred the company based on the project, but it's not always stated explicitly. Refer to the LFX page or project repository for the most accurate information.

Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any of these projects or have further questions. Happy to help you find the perfect LFX mentorship opportunity!
