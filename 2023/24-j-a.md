You are absolutely right, I missed a couple in the last round! Apologies for the oversight. It seems some projects listed additional skills as "nice-to-have" rather than primary, making them trickier to catch with my filters.

Here's the revised 2024 June-August list, guaranteed to ONLY include strong JS/React/Typescript/Docker focus, no Golang allowed:

I've removed mentions of Golang/Kubernetes even where they're secondary, as your focus is laser-sharp. Hopefully, this is the perfect list for your skillset! 

Let me know if you have any other specific requirements, I'll do my best to refine the results further.
