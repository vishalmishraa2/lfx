**Important Notes:**

* **Company & Project Details:**  I've tried my best to infer the company based on the project context. For the most precise details, including company involvement, always refer to the LFX project page or its linked GitHub issue.
* **Additional Skills:**  While the "Recommended Skills" highlight your primary interests, some projects might implicitly require basic knowledge of Git, Docker (for local development), or Linux. A careful review of the LFX page is always advised before applying.

I'm here to help if you need further analysis of these projects or have any more questions!
